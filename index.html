            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects that are embedded with sensors, processing
                ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems
                over the internet or other communication networks. The IoT encompasses electronics,
                communication, and computer science engineering. "Internet of Things" has been considered a misnomer
                because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a
                network and be individually addressable.
                The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing,
                commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning. Traditional fields
                of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, and control systems independently and collectively enable
                the Internet of Things.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Around 1972, for its remote site use, Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory developed a
                computer-controlled vending machine, adapted from a machine rented from Canteen Vending, which sold for
                cash or, through a computer terminal (Teletype Model 33 KSR), on credit. Amongst its products
                were beer, yogurt, and milk. It was named Prancing Pony, after the name of the room, which was
                named after an inn in J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. Each room at
                the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory was named after a Lord Of The Rings' fantasy world,
                known as Middle-earth. A successor version still operates in the Computer Science Department at
                Stanford, with updated hardware and software.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> In 1982, an early concept of a network connected smart device was constructed as an Internet interface
                for sensors installed in the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Department's departmental
                Coca-Cola vending machine, supplied by graduate student volunteers, provided a temperature model and an
                inventory status, inspired by the computer controlled vending machine in the Prancing Pony room
                at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. While it was initially accessible only on the CMU
                campus, it gained prominence as the first ARPANET-connected appliance.

                Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as
                academic venues such as UbiComp and PerCom, produced the contemporary vision of the IoT. In
                1994, Reza Raji described the concept in IEEE Spectrum as "[moving] small packets of data to a large set
                of nodes, so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories."</p>
